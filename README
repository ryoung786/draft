Hey, what's up.  Football + stats = awesome fantasy football analytics.

Here's an example of how you'd invoke this bad boy, and some example output:

$ python analyzer.py 604965
FREE WEEZY: -17.20
TEAM GRAY GHOSTS: -10.00
DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY: -9.80
INCHES WIDE: -8.80
DARK SECRET: -1.60
XOTICA'S FIRESTORM: 0.80
TEAM GESUALDI: 3.80
TEAM TRYINGTHISYEAR: 8.00
MAKE CHECKS PAYABLE TO EVAN: 9.20
TEAM SCHULER: 13.20
1. JOBIN'S HOLY TRIUMVIRATE: 16.40
MICHAEL VICK'S DOGGY GROOMING: 22.40


Just pass your leagueId into the script and it'll do the rest.  It takes a long time because it actually makes http requests for up-to-date suggested auction values for each position.  ESPN doesn't really have an api for this, so I'm scraping it with BeautifulSoup.  Anyway, enjoy.
